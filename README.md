### Nepal eGovernance Polling System

This project is a polling system designed for the Government of Nepal, built using Next.js, TypeScript, MySQL, and ShadCN. It allows users to participate in polls and provides an admin interface for managing polls and viewing statistics.

### Project Overview
The Nepal eGovernance Polling System is a comprehensive digital democracy platform designed specifically for Nepal's governance needs. This system enables citizens to participate in official polls, surveys, and public consultations in a secure, transparent, and accessible manner.

Nepal's geographical diversity, with regions ranging from remote Himalayan villages to dense urban centers, has historically created barriers to inclusive civic participation. With internet penetration reaching over 65% of the population and growing rapidly, digital solutions offer unprecedented opportunities to bridge these divides. This platform leverages this digital transformation to connect citizens directly with decision-makers across all levels of government.

The system addresses critical challenges in Nepal's governance ecosystem:

- Geographic isolation of rural communities from decision-making processes
- Limited mechanisms for citizens to provide direct input on policies and programs
- Need for standardized, secure systems to collect and analyze public opinion
- Requirements for bilingual (Nepali/English) interfaces that respect cultural contexts
- Increasing demand for transparent governance and accountability

The platform bridges the gap between government institutions and citizens, fostering greater civic engagement and democratic participation across the nation, supporting Nepal's constitutional commitment to inclusive governance and participatory democracy.

### Vision & Mission
## Vision
To revolutionize citizen participation in Nepal's governance processes through a secure, accessible, and transparent digital polling system.

Our vision extends to creating a governance ecosystem where:

- Every citizen, regardless of location, education, or economic status, has equal opportunity to influence governance
- Government decisions at all levels are informed by accurate, representative public input
- Digital democracy tools strengthen rather than replace traditional democratic institutions
- Nepal becomes a regional leader in e-governance innovation and civic technology
- Trust between citizens and government increases through transparent engagement processes
- Democratic values are strengthened through inclusive participation
- Data-driven governance becomes the norm rather than the exception

By 2030, we envision this platform becoming an integral component of Nepal's governance infrastructure, facilitating regular consultation on issues ranging from local infrastructure priorities to national policy frameworks.

## Mission
To provide a robust technological platform that empowers Nepali citizens to actively contribute to policy decisions, government initiatives, and public discourse regardless of geographic location, economic status, or technical proficiency.

Our mission is executed through:

- Building infrastructure that functions reliably across Nepal's diverse technological landscape
- Ensuring usability for citizens with varying levels of digital literacy
- Implementing rigorous security protocols that protect both user privacy and system integrity
- Collaborating with government agencies across federal, provincial, and local levels
- Maintaining strict political neutrality while facilitating democratic expression
- Continuous refinement based on user feedback and technological advancements
- Supporting administrators with tools to design effective consultations and analyze results
- Promoting digital literacy and e-participation through educational initiatives
- Prioritizing accessibility for persons with disabilities, elderly citizens, and marginalized communities
- Creating sustainable operational models that ensure long-term platform viability

The platform's mission acknowledges Nepal's unique context as a young federal democratic republic undergoing rapid digital transformation while honoring its rich cultural heritage and diverse population.
